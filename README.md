## Objective:
The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a loan will default based on the provided features. This involves:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

Model Selection: Applying different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Using techniques like Grid Search to find the best model parameters.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like ROC AUC to ensure accuracy and reliability.
